## About
This is my first project working with a GUI. In this game I'm using java's swing library which is easy to use. In this game I implemented Conway's Game of Life with buttons in grid so you can change the squares as you wish by pausing and clicking on the grid.

## Installing
To install this game you need to GameOfLife.jar file and run it with commandprompt - java -jar GameOfLife.jar or also download Run.bat and doubleclick it and the game should start.

## Usage
To understand how mechanics of this game work, check out this [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Game can be paused by pressing space. By clicking on any square in the grid you can switch color its color. Game starts with randomly generated alive cells.
